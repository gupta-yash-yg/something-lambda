## Flow

roles.sh

    - Create the execution role: role_name

user provided path for function file 

    - Contains the function

menu.sh

    menu:
        opt1:
            - create-function: path_of_zip, role_name, handler, runtime
        opt2:
            - invoke the function: input_json
        opt3:
            - update the function: new path_of_zip
        opt4:
            - delete the function: function_name
        opt5:
            - list the functions 
        opt0:
            exit

    
    helper:
        - create zip file: path


TODO:



- Make a generic function so that (input: list, output: option from list with errors handled)
    - After listing function, while deleting and updating choose the functions with numbers, handle the error case too
    - After listing runtimes choose the runtimes with numbers, handle the error case too

- Add options for choosing memory and cpu time while creating lambda function (and even for update?)

- Provide options to choose from different sources:
    - directory of python where the required filename must be in the root folder along with the requirements.txt
        - Handle for no requirements.txt also
    - node.js?? Check options for compilation
    - Provide option for github for the above 2 cases
    - Custom zip file
        - add additional options for src: s3, github

- Provide apigateway integration (or even addition triggers and destinations)

- While invoking a function provide the option so that user can give a filepath as json payload



- List the runtimes: maintain a deploy.json file which is written by dev
                     timeout
                     memory

runs on local machine
User creates a function with github:
    create function with default handler?
    create a codepipeline with src as github
    create a code deploy for lambda with the current lambda
    create a cloudwatch event for updating the lambda
        take input from user for cronjob
    initiate the first push



Create a lambda function (without any config)
    - aws lambda create-function --function-name testrepo --role arn:aws:iam::557151867487:role/MyLambdaRole --runtime python3.7 --zip-file "fileb://testlambda.zip" --handler test.f1

Read a github repo (say python)
